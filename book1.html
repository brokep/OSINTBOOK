<h4 class="card-title">OSINT Techniques</h4>
<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Resources for Uncovering Online Information - 10th Edition (2023)</h6>
<hr/>
<p class="card-text"><b>36 chapters | 260,000 words | 550 pages | Hardcover & Paperback</b><br><br>
It is time to look at OSINT in a different way. For many years, and within the previous editions of this book, we have relied on external resources to supply our search tools, virtual environments, and investigation techniques. We have seen this protocol fail us when services shut down, websites disappear, and custom resources are dismantled due to outside pressures. This book aims to correct our dilemma. We will take control of our investigative resources and become self-reliant. There will be no more need for online search tools; we will make and host our own locally. We will no longer seek pre-built virtual machines; we will create and configure our own. The new OSINT professional must be self-sustaining and possess their own tools and resources. You will become a more proficient subject matter expert who will be armed with the knowledge and readiness to articulate the sources of your findings.<br><br>
This new 10th edition contains hundreds of pages which have been updated to keep your OSINT investigative methods fresh. It includes new online and offline search tools; a new Linux OSINT virtual machine; and tutorials to replicate Linux OSINT tools within Mac and Windows operating systems. Brand-new search methods for Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others ensure you have the latest techniques within your online investigation arsenal. An entire section is devoted to Methodology, Workflow, Documentation, and Ethics which provides a clear game plan for your next active investigation. All digital files are included via download. Today, we start over.

<h4 class="card-title">10th Edition Changes & Summary</h4>
<hr/>
<p class="card-text">If you have the 9th edition of this book, you may want to know what has changed in this 10th edition. The previous edition of this book was originally written in late 2021. In late 2022, I was asked to update this book, as it is required reading for numerous college courses, university degrees, and government training academies. I never want stale or inaccurate information being presented within training programs, so I created this special revision. I estimate that 20% of the content is brand new, 20% has been updated to reflect changes throughout 2022, and the remaining 60% is recycled from the from the previous edition. Much of the ninth edition content was still applicable and only needed minor updates to reflect changes since 2021. If you have read the previous edition, you will find most of those overall strategies within this book. However, I have added many new OSINT methods which complement the original text in order to cater to those who always need accurate information. I also removed a lot of outdated content which was no longer applicable. I believe there is much new value within this updated text. The majority of the updates are available in chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 23, 28, 30, 31, 32, and 33, along with the digital files which accompany them. The other chapters all have minor updates.<br><br>
This edition presents six new chapters unavailable within previous versions. These include Broadcast Streams (23), Application Programming Interfaces (28), and an entire new section containing four chapters about Data Leaks (30), Data Breaches (31), Stealer Logs (32), and Ransomware (33). I am very excited to release these new chapters, as I believe they introduce the future of OSINT analysis.<br><br>
All purchases include free download of updated custom search tools; updated Linux, Mac, and Windows OSINT scripts to build your own virtual machines; detailed cheat-sheets to simplify each process; and a single Linux command to build a complete 2023 OSINT VM with every tool in the entire book. <b>You can find your custom login link and credentials within chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 of each book which provides permanent online access to all files.</b> The outline is below.<br><br>

An e-book version of this release is not currently available. This is due to many reasons, including rampant piracy, counterfeit prints, Kindle tracking, exclusivity requirements, and unpredictable content removal from Amazon. We believe this book is better served as a printed reference manual.
